										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a newbie to managing a WordPress website, then congratulations! You are here at the right track with us because we are going to introduce you one of the most basic knowledge when owning a WordPress page: how to find your site the best WordPress Hosting service. This process is often overlooked by most of the website owners. But it can be considered the most important key point to bring your site to stand out of the crowd. A great hosting service could help you to improve SEO and increase sales as well.</p>
<p>But first thing first, what is a hosting? Well, basically it is a space that contains all the data related to your website such as your source codes, uploaded contents (images, sounds and other media) and your database. Imagine your site is a mixture of juices and a jar can be considered a hosting.</p>
